# Trellis
---

Trellis is a barebones Timber / Twig theme that gives you the structure you need to quickly get things up and running as quickly as possible.

It is simply used in a bash profile script to allow me to generate a theme for wordpress using twig, while giving me all the structure and helpers I could possibly need so that no tedious legwork is needed when a theme is needed to be made quickly. The following lists what the theme sets up in the functions.php and any other helpful / important things may be needed.

### In the functions.php
-  Timber add to context filter
-  add_scripts function for the wp_enqueue_scripts action
-  Registers a nav menu called main
-  Adds theme support for Post Thumbnails
